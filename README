shrike is a utility application that acts as a testbed
for shaders written in Sh (http://libsh.org/).

See INSTALL for installation instructions and prerequisites.

You can rotate the view by dragging the left mouse button. Dragging
the middle mouse button will bring the object closer and further away
from the camera. The right mouse button can be used to move along the
screen axes.

Holding shift and dragging the left mouse button will rotate the light,
shift and middle button will move it closer or further away from the
object.

Everything else is available from the on-screen menus.

CAVEATS

Note that some of the shaders are not working under some
configurations right now. Usually this is because they use features
only supported by certain graphics cards. For example, the "Branching"
shaders will generally only work under NV40 series cards. Derivatives
don't work under any ATI cards right now. Many shaders don't work
under ATI R3xx (9x00) series cards, since the instruction limits are
very short. In all of these cases you'll see no object being rendered
at all. Sometimes shrike might crash -- sorry.

If you're seeing a black object, you might not have an appropriate
texture. Remember to point shrike at the correct location for shmedia
when compiling it.

If you have any questions, please contact libsh-devel@lists.sf.net.
