shrike is a utility application that acts as a testbed
for shaders written in Sh (http://libsh.sf.net/).

See INSTALL for installation instructions and prerequisites.

You can rotate the view by dragging the left mouse button. Dragging
the middle mouse button will bring the object closer and further away
from the camera. The right mouse button can be used to move along the
screen axes.

Holding shift and dragging the left mouse button will rotate the light,
shift and middle button will move it closer or further away from the
object.

Everything else is available from the on-screen menus.

If you have any questions, please contact libsh-devel@lists.sf.net.
