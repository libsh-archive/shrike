To compile shrike you will need

 - an installed version of libsh, available from
   http://libsh.org/. You'll probably need a version of Sh matching
   the version number of shrike
 - the shmedia package, available from the Sh website.
 - OpenGL
 - a recent glext.h, if you want the ARB backend to work. If you got
   the Sh ARB backend to install you should be fine.
 - wxwidgets, available from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
   ("apt-get install libwxgtk2.6-dev" on Debian)
   NOTE: must be compiled with the --with-opengl option

To get the compilation process going, just run
  ./configure --with-sh=PATH_TO_SH --with-shmedia=PATH_TO_SHMEDIA

Where PATH_TO_SH and PATH_TO_SHMEDIA are the installation
directories of Sh and shmedia. If you installed these into your system's
default install directory (e.g. /usr or /usr/local) you won't need
these options, although you will probably need the shmedia one.

Once configure has completed successfully, run
  make
which will compile the program. You should then try running it with
  src/shrike
Optionally you can install shrike with "make install".

See the README file for usage information.
